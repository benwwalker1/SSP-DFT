# Density Functional Theory Examples

## Description

A set of four quantum espresso simulation configurations to solve for various material/chemical properties.

## Installation

Install the latest Python and Quantum Espresso (QE) versions, and ensure the QE binaries `pw.x` and `bands.x` are your `$PATH` variable.

## Usage

### diamond-scf Usage

Run the `e-cutoff.py`,`k-points.py`, and `lattice.py` scripts in the `diamond-scf` directory, and modify the QE input file `diamond-scf.in` as necessary to maintain convergence

### diamond-bands Usage

Run the `diamond-bands.py` script in the `diamond-bands` directory to automatically calculate the self-consistent field electron density, and to calculate the band structure across the various k-points defined in `diamond-bands-make.in`.

### graphene-bands Usage

Run the `graphene-bands.py` script in the `graphene-bands` directory to automatically calculate the self-consistent field electron density, and to calculate the band structure across the various k-points defined in `graphene-bands-make.in`.

### methane Usage

Simply run the command `rw.x < methane.in > methane.out` to have Quantum Espresso optimize the methane structure! To change the initial guess, generate new hydrogren positions via `initial-positions.py` and copy/paste them into the `ATOMIC_POSITIONS` in the `methane.in` file. To visualize the data, load the output file into XCrysgen
